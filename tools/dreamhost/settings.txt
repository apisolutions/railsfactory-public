you need to configure the app to modify the ruby path in shebang line in public/dispatch.fcgi
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

and make it executable, but I prefer to do it on svn as it will set the permission whenever we do fresh checkouts/deployment


on public/.htaccess from dispatch.cgi to dispatch.fcgi
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]

on config/environment.rb
 ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'production'


#svn commands from project root folder
svn remove log/*
svn propset svn:ignore "*.*" log/

svn remove tmp/sessions/*
svn propset svn:ignore "*.*" tmp/sessions/
svn propset svn:ignore "*.*" tmp/cache/
svn propset svn:ignore "*.*" tmp/sockets/

if you use folders which will have dynamically generated content, uploaded file, please ignore them as well, and later symilink as described in manual_deploy.txt


svn remove public/images/Thumbs.db
svn propset svn:ignore "Thumbs.db" public/images/


svn propset svn:executable ON public/dispatch.fcgi


svn ci -m "removing tmp session files, thumbnail index and ignoring them in the future"
svn up
